# ReactJS AutoCompletion Component

The component uses multiple APIs:

 - Google Search API
 - Bing Search API
 - Github Search API

# Functionnalities

The component is mainly an Input where users write their query, and a select list to select on which search engine they want the completion to fetch data.
The fetching process is triggered each time the input is changed, or the engine is changed.

## Design

The demo uses Materialize.css for aesthetic reasons, to make the display pretty.
